       <p> Todayâ€™s agriculture community needs a drastic change, to remove middlemen/agents between the sale and purchase. The presence of middlemen has made the income of farmers stagnant, because middlemen buy produce from farmers at much lower costs than the Minimum Support Price specified. A state monopoly has been established over these markers and farmers are unable to sell their goods in the open market. 
        </p>
<p> Systems need to be designed to ensure that farmers are able to sell their produce directly to the super markets without any middlemen, thereby increasing the income of the farmers. The systems built need to be transparent where farmer can control the sale and his produces. 
Our website facilitates these open transactions for farmers.</p>
